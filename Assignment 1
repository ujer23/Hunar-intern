Prepared by: [Madiha Khan]  
Position: IT Intern, Hunar

# Task 1: Password Policy Review

# Current Password Policy
- Minimum Password Length: 8 characters
- Complexity Requirements: At least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character
- Expiration: Passwords expire every 90 days
- Password Reuse:  Cannot reuse passwords from the last five cycles
- Account Lockout: Locks after five unsuccessful attempts with a 15-minute lockout

# Strength Assessment
Sample passwords were tested using online tools like Have I Been Pwned and Kaspersky Password Checker. The assessment highlighted that:
- 8-character passwords are prone to compromise.
- Simple patterns (like "efdd442l#!") remain weak, even with special characters.

# Recommendations
1. Increase Minimum Length: Set a 12-character minimum.
2. Enhanced Complexity : Require at least three of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

4. Extend Expiration:  Change expiration to 180 days for stronger passwords with MFA.
5. Encourage Password Manager Use: Help users manage secure, unique passwords.
6. User Training: Provide training on strong password creation and common pitfalls.
